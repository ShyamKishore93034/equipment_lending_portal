# Enhanced AI-Assisted API for School Equipment Lending Portal

// AI Reflection: This README was partially generated by AI (e.g., prompt: "Write a README for an AI-refactored equipment lending API with enhancements").

Refactored with async/await, validation, password hashing, auto-DB init, and enhancements: request history, usage analytics, user-specific requests, pagination.

Setup:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev

New Endpoints:
- /api/request/history?user_id= (with pagination ?page=1&limit=10)
- /api/equipment/analytics
- /api/request/my (user's own requests)
